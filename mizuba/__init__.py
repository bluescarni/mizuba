    # NOTE: on some platforms Python by default opens extensions
    # with the RTLD_LOCAL flag, which creates problems because
    # public symbols used by heyoka (e.g., sleef functions, quad
    # precision math) are then not found by the LLVM jit machinery.
    # Thus, before importing core, we temporarily flip on the
    # RTLD_GLOBAL flag, which makes the symbols visible and
    # solves these issues. Another possible approach suggested
    # in the llvm discord is to manually and explicitly add
    # libheyoka.so to the DL search path:
    # DynamicLibrarySearchGenerator::Load(“/path/to/libheyoka.so”)
